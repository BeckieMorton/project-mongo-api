# Project Mongo API

My first week learning about MongoDB. I created my own API and database with MongoDB, stored and retrieved data and produced several RESTful APIs using Mongoose methods instead of plain JavaScript to deal with the filtering etc.

<ins>My endpoints include:</ins> 
    "path": "/",
    "path": "/sites",
    "path": "/date/:dateinscribed",
    "path": "/country/:country",
    "path": "/name/:name",

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem: My success from last week's journey into Express API did not continue into this week! For some reason, I was bothered by multiple terminal errors from the beginning of writing code and most of my week was spend trying to connect to my database. I ended up commenting out my seeding code and importing my database through compass.

At this stage I was able to create several end points

How did you plan?: Course content was helpful but I had major issues and errors trying to get the code alongs to work for me, meaning several days of trial and error. I kept it simple, leaving everything in the server.js file.

What tools and techniques you used to solve it: Our course content as well as advice from code coaches, Stack Overflow and I even used ChatGPT a few times while trying to solve errors. I attempted to separate my code into the recomented file structure (eg. with routes, mode, server) but this caused many errors so I kept it simple this week.

What technologies did you use?: MongoDB. Mongoose, Mongo Compass, Mongo Atlas, JS, Routers

If you had more time, what would be next?:
